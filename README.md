# ML-term-project
PHYS8001 course project. Attempted to do machine learning classification of a SUSY dataset

The course reading material: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157319300766

The SUSY dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY

In this project, I spent a bit of time figuring out how to handle the dataset. Then I discovered that the classification I wanted to do was way above my skill level. So I tried for some simpler methods, but it turned out the dataset was too advanced for these methods. Ultimately, I was not successful. But I did learn a lot in the process, and intend to continue this project in the future.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook file as well as the slides for my presentation.
